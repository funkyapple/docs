# Utilities

In the Mac ecosystem, there can be found a whole array of useful utilities that can help boost productivity. Not all of them are necessary but I have found many of them helpful. How does this differ from the Developer section of this guide? Well it's more focused on polished and less technical utilities that doesn't involve coding. Make no mistake however, some of the tool presented here are super powerful and versitile.

## iStat Menus

Being able to view critical pieces of information about the status of your various computer components is super useful. I can tell if the CPU is being maxed and in additon what is utilizing it within a couple seconds. It's like activity monitor but embedded in your menu bar. It's one of the features I miss about my Linux setup. Definetely would recommend.

## Fantastical

For some, seeing the calendar and being able to interact with it from the Menu bar is absolutely essential. In addition, the natural language processing is absolutely amazing. There is also a great Alfred workflow to quickly add events to the calendar using this natural language processing.
