A major shoutout to [The Geek Coolbook](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/) who largely inspired me to get into servers. I'd like to thing of myself as the idiots guide. I even copied his home page. 

## What this guide hopes to achieve? 

I'd like to think of this as a documentation of my journey. Hopefully you learn along the way.
