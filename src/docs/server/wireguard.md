# Wireguard

I ended up using `wg-easy` to create Wireguard tunnels for some family and friends that need a VPN occationally. I attempted to install wireguard directly to gain some performance benefits. I kept having routing issues (I suspect something was going funky with tailscale). 

## Client configure

Download `.conf` file and load into wireguard client downloaded from.
