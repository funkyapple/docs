# Getting Started

Docker makes the world go round... almost. Before you begin playing with servers, you first need to get some basics under your belt. First learn how to use the command line. This is pretty much essential. Unless you are using unraid, most servers run on some form of linux.

You can take a look at [The Linux Command Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-linux-commands-handbook/#introductiontolinuxandshells). Start by learning how to use `cd` and `ls` to navigate the file tree. Then you can get fancy with all the other commands. You tend to just pick them up over time. 

Another essential is learning docker. I made the mistake of just trying docker without knowing how it worked. It caused me so much pain and headache. Don't make the same mistake. Again, use the [The Docker Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-docker-handbook/) by freeCodeCamp. It's amazing. Read through the first couple sections to get a sense of how docker works. You won't really need to know how to build your own containers as most of the time we will be using premade containers. But still, its helpful to understand how docker works. Then skip to docker compose. This is what you will be using most of the time. 

Okay, so you are now ready to begin.
