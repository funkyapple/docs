How to actual run and test the documents. The easiest way is to use poetry but honestly you can also use pip.

1. Install [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) and [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (recommended).
2. Fork and clone the repo to your device.
3. In the repo folder type:
```
poetry install
```
4. This will install all the required dependancies. Make sure poetry shell is activated by typing `poetry shell` and then run:
```
mkdocs serve
```
Make the intended edits and then merge back to `master` as a PR.
